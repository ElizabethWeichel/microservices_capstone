# microservices_capstone
Description of files in repo: <br/>
  
**my_grad_desc.py**: This is the implementation of gradient descent. It can be customized for a signular Job type or multiple, as well as different numbers/combinations of microservices in use. <br/>
  
**python_parsing folder**: The output of my_grad_desc.py puts the data into an excel file. This folder has multiple scripts that take as input the data and graphs them. <br/>
  
**preliminary folder**: This folder contains train_sequential.py (the sequential scaling algorithm that was the first written to test the simulator). It also contains the first attempt at implementing gradient descent using the action as a change in allocation rather the allocation itself. <br/>
